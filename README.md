### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m Dinh Thai Tuan from Hanoi, Vietnam.
🎓 I’m currently an undergraduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics at VNU – University of Science (2022–2026).
📌 I’m passionate about quantitative finance, stochastic calculus, and mathematical modeling. My career goal is to pursue a Master's ( maybe PhD ? ) degree in Applied Mathematics and probably work in something fun? 

🧠 I enjoy combining math and programming to solve complex problems. I'm especially interested in modeling financial systems and analyzing market behaviors using statistical and machine learning methods.

📈 I'm currently a Research Consultant at WorldQuant BRAIN, where I develop predictive models (alphas) using Python and WorldQuant’s internal language. My work has consistently ranked in the top 2% out of 7,000+ consultants.

💻 I’ve also interned at Institute of Physics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (Vietnamese: Viện Hàn lâm Khoa học và Công nghệ Việt Nam) is the largest and most prominent research institute in Vietnam and participated in a research program in Mathematical Biology at NWU, Japan, where I worked on ODEs and stochastic simulations.
