Hi, I’m Dinh Thai Tuan from Hanoi, Vietnam.
Math & CS Student at heart.
My research involving AI + Physics, sometimes a little math if needed.
Recently I finally decide to pursue academic studies, probably in Mathematics Applied in general, Neural Network in specify. 
I also want to do some finance-related project, so ping me if you want to collab.
