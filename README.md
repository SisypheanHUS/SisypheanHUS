### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dinh Thai Tuan from Hanoi, Vietnam.  
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics at VNU â€“ University of Science (2022â€“2026).  
ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m passionate about quantitative finance, stochastic calculus, and mathematical modeling. My career goal is to pursue a Master's (maybe PhD?) degree in Applied Mathematics and work in something fun, like quant research or AI-driven risk modeling!

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on ...**  
- Developing predictive alphas for financial instruments at WorldQuant BRAIN (Remote, Apr. 2024â€“Present). Ranked in the top 2% of 8,000+ consultants based on alpha performance, operator efficiency, and more till now. 

+ Iâ€™ve also contributed to research on epidemic modeling at Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (Aug.â€“Nov. 2025), stochastic simulations in Mathematical Biology at Nara Womenâ€™s University, Japan (Aug. 2025), and deep learning for Raman Spectroscopy at the Institute of Physics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (July 2025â€“Present). There, I compared 1D vs. 2D CNNs for detecting methanol in ethanol mixtures.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning ...**  
- Advanced stochastic processes and deep learning applications in quantitative risk management.  
- Honing skills in R for epidemic modeling (from NWU project) and Python/Java for quant finance.

ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...**  
- Open-source projects in mathematical modeling, quant finance simulations, or AI for scientific data analysis.  
- Feel free to reach out for joint research or competitions!

ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with ...**  
- Optimizing neural networks for spectroscopic data or scaling stochastic models for real-time finance predictions.

Ask me about quantitative finance, epidemic modeling, or Camus-inspired perseverance in math!
