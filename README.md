### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dinh Thai Tuan from Hanoi, Vietnam.
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics at VNU â€“ University of Science (2022â€“2026).
ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m passionate about quantitative finance, stochastic calculus, and mathematical modeling. My career goal is to pursue a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics in Hungary and work in investment banking or quantitative research.

ðŸ§  I enjoy combining math and programming to solve complex problems. I'm especially interested in modeling financial systems and analyzing market behaviors using statistical and machine learning methods.

ðŸ“ˆ I'm currently a Research Consultant at WorldQuant BRAIN, where I develop predictive models (alphas) using Python and WorldQuantâ€™s internal language. My work has consistently ranked in the top 2% out of 7,000+ consultants.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve also interned as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Vietnam, and participated in a research program in Mathematical Biology at NWU, Japan, where I worked on ODEs and stochastic simulations.
